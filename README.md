# Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Initialized in Two Different Modes using the AVR64DD32 Microcontroller with MCC Melody

<br>The repository contains two MPLAB® X projects:

1.  [Sending Data as a Host](#1-sending-data-as-a-host) – Configuring the device in the SPI Host mode to control a Client.
2.  [Host - Client Communication](#2-host---client-communication) – This folder contains two projects: one used to program the device as a Host and one used to program another device as a Client.

## 1. Sending Data as a Host

This example shows how to configure the device in SPI Host mode, and send data to the Client (one byte with the ASCII `H` code).

### 1.1 Setup

The following configurations must be made for this project:

- System clock is configured at 4 MHz
- SPI
  - SPI clock configured at 500 kHz
  - SPI in Host mode
  - Data mode is 0
  - MSB transmitted first
  - Dedicated SPI pins:
    - PA4 (MOSI)
    - PA5 (MISO)
    - PA6 (SCK)

- GPIO
  - PA7 (SS) pin configured as output

|    Pin     | Configuration  |
| :--------: | :------------: |
| PA4 (MOSI) | Digital output |
| PA5 (MISO) | Digital input  |
| PA6 (SCK)  | Digital output |
| PA7 (SS)   | Digital output |

### 1.2 Demo

The MOSI (PA4), SCK (PA6), and SS (PA7) signals captured by a logic analyzer are shown in the image below, whereas the MISO is not shown.<br>When the Host asserts the SS line (low), the Host device generates the SCK signal and sends the ASCII `H` code through the MOSI line.<br>

### 1.3 Summary

This example shows how to configure the device in SPI Host mode, and send data to a Client.<br><br>

## 2. Host - Client Communication

This example shows how to setup and initialize the SPI Host mode and SPI Client mode devices.<br>The device used as a Host sends the ASCII `H` code through the MOSI line. The Client receives a value, if it is correct, it sends the value `C` back to the Host.<br>If the value is not `H`, the Host receives the value `0x00` from the Client.

The diagram below shows how to connect the Host board with the Client board:

### 2.1 Setup – Host Board

The following configurations must be made for this project:

- System clock is configured at 4 MHz
- SPI0
  - SPI clock configured at 500 kHz
  - SPI in Host mode
  - Data mode is 0
  - MSB transmitted first
  - Dedicated SPI pins:
    - PA4 (MOSI)
    - PA5 (MISO)
    - PA6 (SCK)

- GPIO
  - PA7 (SS) pin configured as output

|    Pin     | Configuration – Host |
| :--------: | :------------------: |
| PA4 (MOSI) |    Digital output    |
| PA5 (MISO) |    Digital input     |
| PA6 (SCK)  |    Digital output    |
| PA7 (SS)   |    Digital output    |

### 2.2 Setup – Client Board

The following configurations must be made for this project:

- System clock is configured at 4 MHz
- SPI0
  - SPI in Client mode
  - Data mode 0
  - MSB transmitted first
  - Dedicated SPI pins:
    - PA4 (MOSI)
    - PA5 (MISO)
    - PA6 (SCK)
    - PA7 (SS)

- GPIO
  - Internal pull-up resistor enabled for PA7 (SS)

|    Pin     | Configuration – Client |
| :--------: | :--------------------: |
| PA4 (MOSI) |     Digital input      |
| PA5 (MISO) |     Digital output     |
| PA6 (SCK)  |     Digital input      |
| PA7 (SS)   |     Digital input      |

### 2.3 Demo

To test the functionality, a SPI Host device is used to exchange data with a Client.
<br>The Host transmits the ASCII `H` code as a response to character `C` from the Client.
<br>The Client can also send character `C` as a response to character `H` from the Host.
<br>If the characters `H` and `C` are not received by the communication parties, a NULL character is transmitted.
<br> One AVR64DD32 Curiosity Nano board is used for the SPI Host, while the other is used for the SPI Client.
<br>For visibility, some delays have been inserted between transactions.
